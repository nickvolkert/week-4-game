# Not all that is glitters is gold

### Overview

Gems! Each gem has a randomly assigned value (set my javascript), and by clicking, tinkering, adding and clicking some more, the goal is to match the 'Cystal score to match' to win the game! Simple and fun. Click game instructions to learn more, or just start clicking!

### Before You Begin

This is the week 4 assignment as a part of my pursuit for the Northwestern FullStack Bootcamp Certification.

The project uses the following technology:
1. HTML, CSS and jQuery

2. SVG sprites (that I illustrated)

3. Google Fonts

4. And favicons that change state based on your wins and losses.
