# Not all that is glitters is gold

### Overview

Gems! Each gem has a randomly assigned value (set by javascript), and by clicking, tinkering, adding and clicking some more you can see that some gems have more value that others, and change each time you play! The goal is to match the 'Cystal score to match' above the gems to win the game! Simple and fun. Click game instructions to learn more, or just start clicking!

### Before You Begin

This is the week 4 assignment as a part of my pursuit for the Northwestern FullStack Bootcamp Certification.

The project uses the following technology:
1. HTML, CSS and jQuery

2. An SVG sprite (that I illustrated) that has the rest and hover state of the games that is controlled by CSS.

3. A Google Font called "Press Start 2P".

4. And favicons that change state based on your wins and losses.
